# 2D-Lap-Racer
A 2D Lap Racing game where users are able to enter a username and select a car and track to race on, and compete to submit the best times to the leader board.

The application should be launched upon running the StartMenuUI.java class and this will welcome the user and prompt them to enter a username to get started.

From here the user will be able to select a car design and a track of their choice to race on.

The username, car and track are all saved locally in text files.

The user is then able to race on the selected track using the arrow keys, and should avoid all obstacles otherwise they will be sent back to the start line.

A timer found in the top right of the screen will keep running until the user successfully completes a lap of the track. Once completed, the user is shown a
congratulations screen, telling them their lap time and allowing them to submit their score to the leader board csv file.
